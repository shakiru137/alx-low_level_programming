Coin change program.

Explain the code below 
Write a program in c that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.

Usage: ./change cents
where cents is the amount of cents you need to give back
if the number of arguments passed to your program is not exactly 1, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
you should use atoi to parse the parameter passed to your program
If the number passed as the argument is negative, print 0, followed by a new line
You can use an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent

This is a program written in C that takes a single command-line argument, which represents the amount of money in cents that needs to be converted into coins. The program uses an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent to make change for the given amount.

Here's an explanation of the code:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Check if the number of arguments is exactly 2 (the first argument is the program name)
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Error\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Convert the second argument to an integer
    int cents = atoi(argv[1]);

    // If the amount is negative, print 0 and return
    if (cents < 0) {
        printf("0\n");
        return 0;
    }

    // Initialize a counter for the number of coins
    int num_coins = 0;

    // Loop through each coin value in descending order
    int coin_values[] = {25, 10, 5, 2, 1};
    int num_coin_values = sizeof(coin_values) / sizeof(coin_values[0]);
    for (int i = 0; i < num_coin_values; i++) {
        // Count the number of coins of the current value that can be used
        int num_current_coins = cents / coin_values[i];

        // Add the number of current coins to the total count
        num_coins += num_current_coins;

        // Subtract the value of the current coins from the remaining amount
        cents -= num_current_coins * coin_values[i];
    }

    // Print the total number of coins
    printf("%d\n", num_coins);

    return 0;
}
